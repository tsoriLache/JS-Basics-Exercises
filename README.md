# Create a new repository on your GitHub. This will your repo for JS exercises.
Do each of the following exercises in a separate file, and upload them to your repo on GitHub.
Create a commit for each exercise (if you want you can add more commits for your convenience).
Submit the link to your repository when you're done.
Write a piece of code that computes the sum of digits of a 3-digit number. You can use the template below:
const num = 123
let sum = 0
// your code goes here
console.log(sum)
Test your code on several different 3-digit numbers (for example 666, 300, 725). Hint: you might need to use Math.floor...
Write a piece of code that finds the solutions for a quadratic equation. You can use the following template:
const a = 1; b = -6; c = 9;  // stands for x**2 - 6*x + 9 = 0
let solutionA = solutionB = 0
// your code goes here
console.log(solutionA, solutionB)
You can find on Google the formula to find the solutions. Test your code on different a, b, c values (like 1, 5, 6 or 1, -1, -1)
Write a piece of code that calculates the absolute value of a given number,
WITHOUT using Math.abs (though you still can use other Math methods).
const num = -8
let absolute;
// your code goes here
console.log(absolute)
Test your code on positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
You can run your code using the devtools console, or you can install the Quokka extension for VS Code, or any other method that works for you.

You are given an array of a student's grades during the school year. Your task is to compute the following statistics:
The range of the grades (difference between highest and lowest)
The median grade (the grade in the middle)
The range of the grades from the second half of the school year
Here's a template you can use:
const grades = [73, 91, 88, 56, 62, 84, 95, 96, 88, 92]
// your code goes here
console.log(...)

The output of your code (what console.log prints) should be in the following format (notice the line-breaks and indentation):
Stats:
    Range: 40
    Median: 88
    Half Range: 12
Test your code on different arrays of different sizes.
Separate your code into functions! Avoid code duplication!

Submit this code through your JS GitHub repo. Split your work into several commits.
